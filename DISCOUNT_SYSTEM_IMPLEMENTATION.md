### Discount Calculation Logic
```java
public double getEffectivePrice(Product product) {
    Optional<ProductDiscount> discount = getActiveDiscount(product.getId());
    if (discount.isPresent()) {
        double discountAmount = product.getPrice() * (discount.get().getDiscountPercentage() / 100.0);
        return product.getPrice() - discountAmount;
    }
    return product.getPrice();
}
```

### Time Remaining Display
- Shows days, hours, and minutes remaining
- Special urgent styling for discounts expiring within hours
- Automatically updates without page refresh

### Automatic Cleanup
- Scheduled task runs every hour
- Removes expired discounts from database
- Prevents accumulation of old discount records
